        <h3 style="text-align:center; color:white">High School Years and Before</h3>
        <p style="text-align:center"><font size="4">
          I was born in Istanbul, TURKEY and attended Sisli Terakki Science High School mainly because of my curiosity for science particularly in Physics Math and Biology. Being a science high school student granted me opportunities that normally I wouldn't be able to have. I have had the privelage to establish friendships with great people including some truly remarkable teachers and friends who helped me to further advance myself and my vision. One thing you should know about me is that I love challening myself I just don't like sitting somewhere doing nothing. I like doing research for I am curios about everything. I have to learn a language even if its dead language such as Latin, just for the sake of learning and out of pure curiosity.
        </font></p>
        <br>
        <p style="text-aling:center"><font size="4">
          I've always liked reading biographies of interesting people and complicated books about physics and science in general even though I knew the contents were above me. One day I started reading a book called QED(Quantum Electro Dynamics) the theoretical aspect of that book was admittedly very challenging but what got me interested in reading that book further was not the content but instead the author. The more I read the more I saw myself in the author and thats when I met my personal hero Richard Feynman.
        </font></p>
        <p style="text-align:center"><font size="4">
          Being a passionate science student allowed me to hone my interest in Physics and Mathematics. During High School I felt the need to define my personality and having an identical twin brother further motivated me. I have realized that I loved solving problems when I encountered them while preparing for a robotics contest called 
          <a href="http://www.firstlegoleague.org/">FLL</a>
          . I joined to be a member of my high school's olympiads team for National and International olympiads in Physics, Mathematics, Biology and Geography and thanks to my inexplicable predilection for constantly challenging myself, I competed in olympiads and spent my summer in math camps (
          <a href="https://www.nymathcircle.org/">New York Math Circle</a>
           at NYU Courant Institute). In my junior year I wanted to better myself in public speaking and solving problems other that have real world applications so I participated in a number of Model United Nations including Harvard MUN. In my senior year I competed in Canadian Math Olympiads and Euclid Math Contest and recieved a <b>Distinction</b> and the <b>Euclid Medal</b> from University of Waterloo Mathematics Department.

          Although I loved participating in science olympiads, robotics contests and math camps I wanted to do something much more than that. I knew that I loved research even one time one of my physics teachers told me that my natural habitat is going to be a research lab :) So I started contacting professors in 
          <a href="http://www.phys.boun.edu.tr">Bogazici University Physics Department</a>
           where in previous years of my high school I used to snuck in the lecture halls to listen to physics lectures and seminars. After searching for a while I got invited to talk with a professor doing a research project in BioPhysics. Even though I knew he would say I am not qualified for he usually worked with college students, I went and talked to him. It went better that I had anticipated and soon after I was accepted to be a part of the research he was doing on <b>Development of Photoacoustic Imaging Modality for Cancer Angiogenesis</b> with <b>Medical & Biological Physics Research Group</b> of <b>Bogazici University</b>. In that research I worked with Associate Professor 
           <a href="http://www.phys.boun.edu.tr/faculty_wp/mehmet_burcin_unlu.html">Mehmet Burcin Unlu</a>
           Under his mentorship I have had the privelage of meeting new people, talking to him about new advancements in these fields but most importantly I realized it is more important to work in a field that combines seemingly irrelevant disciplines. Feel free to contact me for the abstract of the research paper I am working on.

        <h3 style="text-align:center; color:white">College Years</h3>
        <p style="text-align:center"><font size="4">
        Reading magazines I grew very fond research labs around the world some famous ones including CERN, Fermilab and Brookhaven Lab but among them one remained special Lawrence Berkeley National Lab for they were doing research nearly in every field that I wanted and they had a history with some of my favorite physicists; Robert Oppenheimer, Ernest Lawrence... Through LBNL I've gotten to know <strong>University of California Berkeley</strong> and Berkeley become my dream school. I was thrilled when I learned that I was accepted to Berkeley and now I am embarking on a new journey to Berkeley to study <b>Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences</b> and combine other disciplines such as Physics and Biology to develop an advancement that can solve problems in the world, the very problems that I had just a glimpse of when I participated in Model United Nations.
